--The benefits for the state of California have been changed based on a local ordinance. 
    So the benefits representative has asked you to compile a list of people who are affected. 
    Write a query to display the employee ID and last name of the employees who work in the state of California. 

select e.employee_id, e.last_name, d.location_id
from employees e join departments d
on e.department_id = d.department_id 
where d.location_id = (select location_id from locations where state_province = 'California')

--Which all departments have more than 3 employees from same city

select l.city, count(employee_id) count_emp
from employees e 
join departments d 
on e.department_id = d.department_id 
join locations l 
on d.location_id = l.location_id 
having count(employee_id) > 3
group by l.city
order by count_emp desc
